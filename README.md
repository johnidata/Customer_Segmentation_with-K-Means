# Customer_Segmentation_with-K-Means
## Mall Customers Clustering Analysis
## Introduction

#### Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets. Those efforts can relate to both communications and product development.

Customer segmentation requires the gathering of specific specific information – data – about customers and analyze it to identify patterns that can be used to create segments.



### Problem Statement
A mall wants to improve its products and improve sales.

To achieve this they need to segment their customers to target market purposes and promotions



### Objectives

The objectives of the project are:
1. To explore the data

2. To segment the customers of the mall based on certain attributes. The attributes under consideration are Annual Income, thus how much the make in a year and Spending Score, how much they spend on each visit to the mall.

3. Analyze each segment with respect to the attributes under consideration (Annual Income, Spending Score)


# Steps

#### 1. Importing libraries
This step involves the importation of tools and libraries to aid the work.


####  2. Data Gathering
The dataset can be obtained from kaggle.


#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Data will be explored using dexcriptive statistics and visualisations. 
Data will be cleaned to make sure there are no errors or missing values.


#### 4. Data Preprocessing for modeling
At this point, the metrics are centered and tranformed to enhace KMeans clustering.

#### 5. Creating Clusters with K-Means Algorithm
This stage involves using the unsupervised machine learning learning algorithm(k-Means) to create clusters.

#### 6. Analysing the clusters
This clusters involves identifying the common characteristics within a cluster based on the attributes (Annual Income, Spending score)



## Definition of Attributes

#### Annual Income
Annual income is the amount of money you receive during the year into your bank account, before any deductions.


#### Spending Score
It is the score(out of 100) given to a customer by the mall authorities, based on the money spent and the behavior of the customer.
